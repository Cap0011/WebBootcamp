          <p>The <b>wolf</b>(Canis lupus[a]), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to
               Eurasia
               and North America. More than thirty <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies_of_Canis_lupus">subspecies of Canis</a> lupus have
               been
               recognized, and gray wolves, as
               colloquially understood, comprise non-domestic/feral subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant member of
               Canidae, males averaging 40 kg (88 lb) and females 37 kg (82 lb). Wolves measure 105–160 cm (41–63 in) in
               length and 80–85 cm (31–33 in) at shoulder height. The wolf is also distinguished from other Canis
               species by
               its less pointed ears and muzzle<sup>[2]</sup>, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is
               nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to
               produce fertile
               hybrids with them. The banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although
               subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.</p>

          <p>Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized
               for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical
               adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature,
               and its highly advanced expressive behaviour. It travels in
               nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by
               their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their own packs
               on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition
               for food within the pack. Wolves are also territorial and
               fights over territory are among the principal causes of
               wolf mortality. The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds
               on large wild hooved mammals as well as smaller animals,
               livestock, carrion, and garbage. Single wolves or mated
               pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than
               do large packs. Pathogens and parasites, notably rabies
               virus, may infect wolves.</p>

               <h2>Etymology</h2>
               <p>The English "wolf" stems from the Old English wulf, which is itself thought to be derived from the
                    Proto-Germanic *wulfaz. The Proto-Indo-European root *wĺ̥kʷos may also be the source of the Latin
                    word
                    for the
                    animal lupus (*lúkʷos).[4][5] The name "gray wolf" refers to the grayish colour of the species.[6]

                    Since pre-Christian times, Germanic peoples such as the Anglo-Saxons took on wulf as a prefix or
                    suffix
                    in
                    their names. Examples include Wulfhere ("Wolf Army", or "He whose army is the wolf"), Cynewulf
                    ("Royal
                    Wolf"),
                    Cēnwulf ("Bold Wolf"), Wulfheard ("Wolf-hard"), Earnwulf ("Eagle Wolf"), Wulfstān ("Wolf Stone")
                    Æðelwulf
                    ("Noble Wolf"), Wolfhroc ("Wolf-Frock"), Wolfhetan ("Wolf Hide"), Isangrim ("Gray Mask"), Scrutolf
                    ("Garb
                    Wolf"), Wolfgang ("Wolf Gait") and Wolfdregil ("Wolf Runner").[7]</p>
